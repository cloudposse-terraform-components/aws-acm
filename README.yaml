# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for requesting an ACM certificate for a domain and adding a CNAME record to the DNS zone
  to complete certificate validation.

  The ACM component is to manage an unlimited number of certificates, predominantly for vanity domains. While the
  [dns-primary](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/dns-primary) component has the ability to generate ACM
  certificates, it is very opinionated and can only manage one zone. In reality, companies have many branded domains
  associated with a load balancer, so we need to be able to generate more complicated certificates.

  We have, as a convenience, the ability to create an ACM certificate as part of creating a DNS zone, whether primary or
  delegated. That convenience is limited to creating `example.com` and `*.example.com` when creating a zone for
  `example.com`. For example, Acme has delegated `acct.acme.com` and in addition to `*.acct.acme.com` needed an ACM
  certificate for `*.usw2.acct.acme.com`, so we use the ACM component to provision that, rather than extend the DNS
  primary or delegated components to take a list of additional certificates. Both are different views on the Single
  Responsibility Principle.

  **Stack Level**: Global or Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      acm:
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          enabled: true
          domain_name: acme.com
          process_domain_validation_options: false
          validation_method: DNS
          # NOTE: The following subject alternative name is automatically added by the module.
          #       Additional entries can be added by providing this input.
          # subject_alternative_names:
          #   - "*.acme.com"
  ```

  ACM using a private CA

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      acm:
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          enabled: true
          domain_name: acme.com
          process_domain_validation_options: false
          dns_private_zone_enabled: true
          certificate_authority_component_name: private-ca-subordinate
          certificate_authority_stage_name: pca
          certificate_authority_environment_name: use2
          certificate_authority_component_key: subordinate
